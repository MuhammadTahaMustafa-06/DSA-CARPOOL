# Carpool App for University Students

## Project Overview

This repository contains the codebase for the Carpool App, a web-based platform designed for university students to facilitate ride-sharing, verify user identities, and promote sustainable transportation within the campus of the National University of Computer & Emerging Sciences, Karachi.

## Introduction

The Carpool App project aims to enhance and transform the existing Carpool application developed during the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course into a more robust, efficient, and feature-rich system. The key objectives include creating a scalable and secure platform, introducing advanced features for route matching and user interaction, and fostering a sense of community among university students.

## Existing System

The existing system, developed as a prototype during the OOP course, provides basic functionality for matching drivers and riders, identity verification using NU_ID, and personal information management. However, it lacks scalability, web accessibility, and advanced features.

## Problem Statement

The limitations of the existing system include scalability issues, lack of accessibility, and the absence of advanced features such as two-way communication, route matching algorithms, and real-time data updates.

## Proposed Solution

The proposed solution is to transform the existing Carpool application into a web-based platform using technologies such as Spring Boot/Spring MVC for the backend, Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, JDBC and MySQL for efficient data storage, and Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for route matching. Additionally, robust user authentication and verification systems will be implemented to ensure user security.

## Salient Features

- **Two-Way Communication:** Riders and drivers can communicate directly through the platform, enabling better coordination for rides.
- **Route Matching:** Advanced algorithms will efficiently connect drivers and riders sharing similar routes.
- **Dashboard:** Users will have a personalized dashboard for updating their information, managing rides, and searching for available rides.
- **User Authentication:** The system will verify users' identities, allowing access exclusively to FAST university students.
- **Scalability:** The web-based platform will be scalable to accommodate a growing user base.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Transitioning to a web-based system will provide a better user experience by allowing access from various devices and locations.

## Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Java (for backend)
- **Framework:** Spring Boot/Spring MVC
- **Web Technologies:** Thymeleaf, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Data Structures and Algorithms:** DSA for route matching
- **User Authentication:** Spring Security
